How to run your code through ctraget or rtarget:
create a text file called phase1.txt (I used notepad)in which you write your solution
then make sure to place the text file into your target folder
then do 
./hex2raw < phase1.txt > raw-phase1.txt 
this command runs your text file though hex2raw and places the new txt file into raw-phase1.txt
then do 
./ctarget <raw-phase1.txt
runnning your solution through ctarget
or do 
./rtarget <raw-phase1.txt
running your solution through rtarget 
dependent on what level you are on
