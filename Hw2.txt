If the application were to output the value of magic8ball[3][4] – what would it be? i.e. what would be
returned from the statement printf(“%s”, magic8ball[3][4]);?

Go over for the first element (64 bytes x 3) = 192 bytes
Go over for the second element (8 bytes x 4) = 32 bytes
192 bytes + 32 bytes = 224 bytes aka 28 lines which translates to the address 0x7fffffffc0d8.
At this line there is 0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67 0x00 0x00 0x00
0x00 = null so the string actually stops at 0x57 0x72 0x6f 0x6e 0x67
Which translates to W r o n g.

It will print out "Wrong".
